## Radio Frequency is the answer .!!!

Hello I'm Matthew I am  a starving software engineer that learned a great  career from  Google,  hashnode , and Facebook 
developer aka  "Meta". Also self tought researcher off of  using the browser chrome . I took a break from building applications today  and was  trying to build  my network web traffic  up and make a alternative back up connection for my applications .Little did I know I built a back up energy source that is the answer!!! "Implementation  radio frequencies "What does  my mobile transmiter  does?  The mobile transmiter that I call it a "PMP" (perfection makes perfection) simply conducts electric magnetic energy from a radio frequency that implemented by duplicating  a frequency and making its own supply unit of a frequency  singal by  using my decoder and my Algorithms that I simply plug in for an hr I've created a source of energy that could one day replace gas cars . A radio frequency power  harvest system  can  capture  and convert 
electric magnetic energy to usable direct  voltage . So if we would to put direct voltage into a battery from a transmiter and implementing  radio frequencies we could have flying cars running off broadcast or radio stations without gas with a high tech transmiter called " PMP" And with a the great decoders we could built systems that have air line traffic control and where everything with transportation  can be run with radio frequencies in the air that we don't even need a steering wheel or roads  where is all run by "PMP" . Where we all can enjoy the ride without traffic, accidents, and getting on time to ur destination with using a timer feature on the transmiter"PMP". Imagine life with no roads and not paying for gas and free transportation to any destination all running by a frequency from a transmiter  that conducts usable direct voltage which will help this planet in so many ways . Oil is getting so many good  souls to fight over a resource that doesn't need to or should  be dug up . Radio frequencies is the answer !!! Thank u for listening to my idea .cm/2 = velocity 
Newton (N) = force 2 friction 
(*C) = temperature 

Example: 
(N)<89cm/2= Defertraite (*C) underlines 62 M/c M/2 "web x rebel " where 62 m/C = "millialuvbugbunny4u " where "web x rebel " an api implements "(hello world ) string attachment focus 31.gif
