## Git hub ? Is it profitable.......

Yes? I'm the guy with cigg !!! .Boo who ?!! I'll quite ðŸ™‚ eventually.  We just celebrated  my older brother birthday his 34th matter of fact on March 21 2022 . Anyway when I got home last night I discovered git hub all over again !! Where I already made my Respiratory two years ago when they offered me a job . I further  more think git hub is pure genius . How they  allow u to use their api and requruite  more people for ur project . U ask if it profitable  ? It all depends on much time I spend on each different platform and top off all  that after I'm done reading and making my mark I than have to go to coding  and actually build the mtf lol ðŸ˜† so idk ? Firebase gituhub Google cloud Facebook developer are all the same but different views .  The contracts of these platforms ARE least of same if u want agree on  something,  that would be it . Is that u can't duplicate ur projects which is fair. I totally understand .I really want  Grizzly 2 Cuts app game launch as quick as I can but Im trying different platforms on where I can get  the most outta my brilliant idea . So I tried firebase facebook developer and now git hub. "Man there all good ".I think I'm going to do  different ideas  for each platform cause I like variety, it's make the work day interesting to me . But 
 the end of the road it's all Code!!#<>[]*()*  And  I don't even  like when other bloggers  says it not unless ur hire a decoder than ur not  getting all the profits . It all comes down to downloading files and working  off ur sdks ,developing  the app and put ur own algorithm and tokens or block chains and web hooks messaging basically  **(making money)and choose if ur going to integrate or montenize .  After doing this for two years I'm finally in the process of actually developing  the outskirts of my app instead of just sharing files and algorithms as my first couple success projects I first did so I'm upgrading  my andriod developing  skills as we know it . And I blog. I know ur suppose to blog on here  to  teach people but really??  I use it as a diary to escape my frustration cause I come so far to come empty handed and how much I've done and be discourge to come this far and not be successful.  So really I'm writing my journey.  Until next time sanDiego anchor man out !!!$$$$@@
